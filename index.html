                <h3>HDAnalyzeR: Streamlining Proteomic Data Analysis for Biomarker Research</h3>
                <p>HDAnalyzeR is an R package I developed to streamline the analysis of proteomics data, offering researchers 
                  an efficient and user-friendly tool to process and interpret large datasets. This project was driven by 
                  the need to enhance the accessibility and reproducibility of proteomic analyses, critical for uncovering 
                  biomarkers and understanding disease mechanisms. By designing and implementing this package, I gained valuable 
                  experience in R programming, software development, and bioinformatics workflows. I also strengthened my ability 
                  to address complex research challenges, optimize data pipelines, and create clear documentation to support the 
                  scientific community.</p>

                <h3>Decoding Cardio-Metabolic Disease Patterns with Multi-Label Classification</h3>
                <p>This project focused on identifying biomarker signatures for patients with co-occurring metabolic and cardiovascular 
                  conditions using multi-label classification techniques. By analyzing complex proteomics datasets, I managed to classify 
                  patients based on overlapping disease states, contributing to a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and 
                  potential therapeutic targets. This experience improved my skills in R programming, advanced statistical modeling, and 
                  bioinformatics. I also learned to visualize highly intricate data in an intuitive and efficient manner, enabling clearer 
                  communication of complex insights.</p>

                  <h3>SciViz: Simplifying Scientific Visualization</h3>
                  <p>SciViz is a Python-based project I initiated to help researchers with an intuitive tool for creating publication-ready 
                    visualizations. Recognizing the weakness of Python to visualize complex data effectively and aesthetically, I designed 
                    SciViz to simplify and enhance the process of data visualization, making it accessible even for those with limited coding 
                    experience. Through this project, I gained hands-on expertise in Python programming, data visualization libraries, and 
                    user-focused software development. I also learned to anticipate user needs and create comprehensive documentation to ensure 
                    usability.</p>

                  <h3>Protein Secondary Structure Prediction with Neural Networks</h3>
                  <p>As part of my Master’s program in Molecular Techniques in Life Science, I undertook a bioinformatics project focused on 
                    improving protein secondary structure prediction using neural networks. Leveraging multiple sequence alignment data and 
                    a sliding window approach, I developed a model that achieved higher prediction accuracy. To optimize performance, I incorporated 
                    advanced techniques such as dropout and ensemble modeling, ensuring robustness and reliability. The project emphasized the 
                    critical role of hyperparameter tuning and architectural design in boosting model effectiveness, as demonstrated by strong 
                    evaluation metrics.</p>
